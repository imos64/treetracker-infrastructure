# Enterprise Blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric) Integration with Greenstand Treetracker Platform

## Introduction

Greenstand’s Treetracker project connects people and communities planting trees around the world with donors and investors. Growers use the mobile app to take geotagged photos of each tree, and these captures are uploaded to a verification platform ([greenstand.org](https://greenstand.org)). Once a tree is verified, its Impact Token can be traded; donors and investors can purchase tokens directly from growers, providing income and incentives for reforestation ([greenstand.org](https://greenstand.org)). This system demands transparency and trust: donors must be certain that each token reflects a verified tree, and growers need assurance that their contributions and rewards are accurately recorded. To meet these requirements, Greenstand is exploring an enterprise blockchain solution based on Hyperledger Fabric (HLF).

Hyperledger Fabric is an open-source, permissioned blockchain platform built for business applications. Unlike permissionless networks, Fabric uses deterministic consensus and membership services to ensure that only authorised participants transact and that their transactions cannot be altered ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)). Fabric’s modular architecture supports pluggable consensus algorithms, private communication channels, and rich programming models for smart contracts. This documentation explains how Hyperledger Fabric can be integrated with the Treetracker system and provides guidance for a production-ready deployment.

## Hyperledger Fabric Overview

### Permissioned and Modular Design

In Hyperledger Fabric, every actor—peers, orderers, client applications and administrators—possesses a digital identity encapsulated in an X.509 certificate ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)). Identities are issued by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) and form the basis for a Membership Service Provider (MSP) which determines who may read, write or configure data ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)). The platform separates the execution of smart contracts (chaincode), transaction ordering and validation, improving performance and allowing organisations to plug in different components as needed ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)).

**Key features of Hyperledger Fabric include:**

- **Deterministic consensus:** Fabric’s ordering service uses deterministic algorithms rather than probabilistic mechanisms. A block validated by a peer is guaranteed to be final and correct, preventing forks ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)).

- **Private communication channels:** A channel is a private subnet of communication among specific organisations; each channel has its own ledger, smart contracts and policies ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)). Channels allow competitors to coexist on the same network while keeping sensitive data isolated ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)).

- **Smart contracts (chaincode):** Business logic is encapsulated in chaincode, which endorsing peers execute to produce a read/write set; the endorsement policy specifies which peers must sign a transaction ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)).

- **State database:** Peers maintain a world state and a blockchain. The world state stores current values of ledger states, while the blockchain stores the history of transactions. Once transactions are appended to the blockchain, they cannot be modified ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)).

- **Pluggable databases:** Fabric supports LevelDB (embedded key-value store) and CouchDB (external document database). CouchDB enables JSON queries and indexing but requires extra setup ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)).

### Consensus and Ordering Service

Fabric’s ordering service packages endorsed transactions into blocks, determines their order and delivers them to peers. The recommended implementation is **Raft**, a crash-fault-tolerant (CFT) consensus algorithm introduced in Fabric 1.4.1 ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)). Raft uses a leader–follower model: a leader is elected per channel and replicates transactions to follower orderers ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)). If a leader fails, a new leader is elected, and the system continues as long as a quorum (a majority of orderer nodes) remains ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)). In production, organisations typically deploy three or five orderer nodes across different data centres to ensure high availability ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)).

## Treetracker Integration Architecture
<img width="1449" height="658" alt="HLF TT Arch2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9d5f450-78cc-4236-ad02-8d300d1c13b0" />

### Client Applications

- **Mobile Treetracker App:** A application for growers. It allows users to capture a tree’s photo and location, compute the image’s hash, and submit this data to the blockchain.
- **Web Map Interface:** A Next.js web app that displays verified trees using data from the blockchain and an off-chain database.
- **Admin Panel:** A React dashboard that lets authorised verifiers review tree submissions and update their status.
- **Wallet Application:** A user interface where Impact Tokens can be viewed, transferred or traded.

### API Gateway and Supporting Services

- **HLF Gateway Service:** A Node.js (or TypeScript) service that acts as the client interface to Fabric. It uses the Fabric Gateway API, which simplifies transaction processing by handling endorsement collection and submission to the orderer ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)). The gateway performs functions like evaluating a transaction (read-only query), collecting endorsements, submitting transactions and waiting for commit status ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)).

- **Identity Management:** Integration with Fabric CA for user registration, enrollment and certificate issuance. Users authenticate via a separate identity provider (e.g., Keycloak) and receive X.509 certificates for blockchain access. Fabric CAs support registration of identities, issuance of enrolment certificates, renewal and revocation ([hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io)).

- **Off-chain Database:** PostgreSQL is used to store metadata (tree attributes, user profiles), image hashes and query-optimised views. Sensitive data remains off-chain; only hashes and references are stored on the blockchain. CouchDB is used as the state database on peers for queryable JSON storage ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)).

- **Event Listeners:** Microservices subscribe to block and chaincode events through the Fabric gateway. When a tree is verified, they update the off-chain database and trigger token minting.

### Security and Compliance

- **TLS/mTLS Encryption:** The Fabric CA documentation emphasises enabling TLS for the CA server; without TLS, the CA is vulnerable to network attacks ([hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io)). Similarly, all peer-to-peer and client-peer communications should use TLS and, where appropriate, mutual TLS for authentication.

- **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs):** Private keys for orderers, peers and gateway clients should be stored in HSMs or soft HSMs. Fabric CA can be configured to use external HSMs ([hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io)).

- **Audit Logging:** The immutable blockchain ledger records every transaction. The ledger is comprised of a blockchain (immutable sequence of blocks) and a world state; once a transaction is appended to the blockchain, it cannot be altered ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)). This immutable audit trail satisfies regulatory requirements.

- **GDPR and Data Privacy:** Sensitive data is kept off-chain in PostgreSQL, while hashed references are stored on-chain. Private data collections may specify a `blockToLive` property to purge private data after a certain number of blocks, enabling data expiry to support right-to-be-forgotten requirements ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)).

## Hyperledger Fabric Network Setup
<img width="1407" height="780" alt="HLF TT Arch3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b9a81b3-8a5d-4d2a-a23b-acc68aba3fb0" />

### Ordering Service

A **Raft** ordering service is provisioned with five orderer nodes, distributed across multiple data centres for high availability. Raft is crash-fault-tolerant; it can withstand the loss of up to two nodes in a five-node cluster ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)). Each channel runs its own Raft instance, electing a leader per channel ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)). Organisations may specify which of their orderer nodes participate in each channel ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)).

### Peers

Each organisation runs endorsing and committing peers. Endorsing peers execute chaincode and produce proposal responses; committing peers validate transactions and update their ledgers. Peers use a **gossip** protocol to discover other peers, disseminate blocks and private data, and keep ledgers consistent ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)). Gossip also elects leaders within organisations to efficiently pull blocks from the ordering service ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)).

### Channels
<img width="1036" height="927" alt="HLF TT Arch4 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90d8410b-3357-4bbc-8297-7a765d24cd11" />

Treetracker uses several channels:

- **Public Channel:** Contains tree registration, verification and token transfer data. All participating organisations—Greenstand, CBOs, investors and verifiers—have access. Each organisation designates **anchor peers** to communicate with peers in other organisations. A channel is a private subnet where all transactions are confidential among its members ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)).

- **Private Channels:** Used for sensitive organisational data, e.g., investor commitments or verification notes. Only authorised organisations join these channels.

- **Cross-Channel Transactions:** For multi-organisation interactions, Fabric supports cross-channel data referencing (private data cross-channel flows require careful endorsement policies).

### Certificate Authorities and Identity

For each organisation, a root CA issues certificates for one or more intermediate CAs. Intermediate CAs issue X.509 certificates to users, peers and orderers. The Fabric CA server is initialised with a CSR (Certificate Signing Request) specifying fields like Common Name (CN), organisation (O), organisational unit (OU), location (L), state (ST) and country (C) ([hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io)). The server can generate a self-signed CA certificate or obtain a certificate signed by a parent CA ([hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io)). TLS is enabled to secure enrolment and registration ([hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io)). The Membership Service Provider (MSP) uses these certificates to define valid identities and assign roles ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)).

### Smart Contracts (Chaincode)
<img width="1199" height="575" alt="HLF TT Arch5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/783b3383-c875-456d-8d48-a6c9ddabf5a6" />

Chaincode encapsulates the business logic of Treetracker. Four main contracts are envisaged:

- **TreeContract:** Functions to register a tree, update its status, verify tree data and query history. For example, the `RegisterTree` function validates input parameters, checks that the tree does not already exist, creates a tree asset and stores it on the ledger. The chaincode then returns an error if the tree ID is empty or already exists, and updates the ledger state accordingly. Smart contracts should perform thorough input validation and avoid duplicate IDs ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)).

- **TokenContract:** Handles the creation (minting), transfer and burning of Impact Tokens. Tokens are minted once a tree is verified, linking a token’s ownership to a specific tree ID in the ledger.

- **UserContract:** Manages user registration, profile updates and permission grants. User attributes (roles, organisation) are stored off-chain but referenced in the ledger for auditability.

- **AuditContract:** Logs transactions, creates audit trails and performs compliance checks. Each log entry contains a transaction ID, actor identity, action, resource ID and timestamp.

Chaincode runs in a Docker container managed by peers. Fabric’s **new chaincode lifecycle** involves packaging, installing, approving and committing chaincode definitions. An endorsement policy—such as requiring Greenstand and Verifier peers to sign tree verifications—is defined when committing the chaincode ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)).

---

## Transaction Flow Mapping
<img width="1562" height="409" alt="HLF TT Arch6" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94ef183a-e952-4948-8351-ec4a56a6655b" />

A typical tree registration and token issuance flow maps onto Fabric’s transaction flow ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)):

1. **Tree Capture:** A grower uses the mobile app to capture a photo and GPS coordinates. The app hashes the image and sends a transaction proposal to the Fabric gateway.

2. **Proposal Evaluation:** The gateway selects endorsing peers and forwards the proposal. The endorsing peers validate the proposal’s structure, ensure it has not been submitted before and that the submitter is authorised ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)). Each peer executes the `RegisterTree` function, producing a read/write set but not updating the ledger. ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)).

3. **Endorsement Collection:** Endorsing peers sign the proposal response. The gateway verifies that all responses match and assembles a transaction ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)).

4. **Ordering:** The transaction is sent to the ordering service, which orders transactions into blocks. In Raft, the ordering node routes the transaction to the current leader for that channel; the leader replicates the log entry to followers ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)). Once a majority of orderers (a quorum) agree on the block, it is committed and distributed ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)).

5. **Validation and Commit:** Each committing peer receives the block, verifies that the endorsement policy is satisfied and checks for any read/write conflicts ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)). Valid transactions are committed to the ledger and the world state is updated; invalid transactions are tagged accordingly ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)). A commit event is emitted to notify the application.

6. **Token Minting:** An event listener service detects the tree verification transaction and invokes the `MintImpactToken` function on the TokenContract, creating tokens for the grower. The updated token balance is stored on the ledger and synchronised with the off-chain wallet application.

---

## Private Data and Confidentiality

Greenstand’s blockchain must protect sensitive data (e.g., precise GPS coordinates or personal data) while keeping proof of environmental impact accessible. Hyperledger Fabric addresses this through **private data collections**. A private data collection is defined in the chaincode definition and specifies which organisations are allowed to access the data ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)). Properties include:

- **policy:** A Signature policy listing organisations permitted to store the data ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)).

- **requiredPeerCount / maxPeerCount:** Minimum and maximum numbers of peers to disseminate data to at endorsement time, ensuring redundancy ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)).

- **blockToLive:** Number of blocks after which private data is purged from peers; a value of `0` retains data indefinitely ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)).

- **memberOnlyRead / memberOnlyWrite:** Flags restricting read/write access to collection members ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)).

During tree registration, only a **hash** of the image and location is written to the public ledger. The actual image and precise location remain **off-chain**, and the private data collection stores the hash and metadata accessible only to authorised organisations.

---

## Data Dissemination and Gossip

Hyperledger Fabric implements a **gossip protocol** to disseminate ledger data and maintain consistency across peers. Each peer gossips messages to a random subset of peers, ensuring scalable and reliable distribution ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)). Gossip performs the following functions ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)):

- **Peer discovery and membership management** — peers continually identify available peers and detect offline peers.  
- **Private data dissemination** — endorsing peers disseminate private data to authorised peers in the collection.  
- **Block dissemination** — leader peers pull blocks from the ordering service and optionally gossip them to peers within their organisation ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)).  
- **State transfer** — new peers can pull blocks from other peers to catch up to the latest ledger height.

Leader election within an organisation may be static or dynamic. **Static leader election** designates specific peers as leaders; **dynamic leader election** allows peers to elect a leader based on heartbeat messages ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)). This mechanism ensures efficient ordering-service bandwidth usage and high availability.

---

## Off-Chain Data and Database Integration

Hyperledger Fabric’s world state stores only key–value data. For Treetracker, large assets such as images, high-resolution GPS data and complex queries require an external database. The integration uses:

- **PostgreSQL** for tree metadata, user profiles, tokens and audit logs. It supports rich queries, analytics and compliance requirements.

- **CouchDB** as the peer’s state database. CouchDB allows storage of JSON documents and supports JSON queries and indexing ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)). JSON data modelling enables chaincode to query the ledger using selectors like  
  `{ "selector": {"docType":"asset","owner": <OWNER_ID> } }`  
  ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)). It is recommended to model data as JSON for auditing and reporting ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)).

Off-chain data and on-chain hashes must be synchronised via **event listeners**. The event listener reads block events, extracts transaction data and updates the PostgreSQL database. The database can store indices for fast lookup (e.g., by grower or species) and support GIS queries for mapping.

---

## Identity and Access Control

### Digital Certificates and MSPs

Every actor in a Fabric network has a digital identity in the form of an X.509 certificate ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)). These certificates are issued by a hierarchy of CAs, starting with a root CA, then intermediate CAs for each organisation. When the CA server is initialised, a self-signed certificate or a certificate signed by a parent CA is generated ([hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io)). The certificate’s subject contains fields such as Common Name (CN), Organisation (O) and location ([hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io)). The MSP defines the rules for valid identities and maps attributes to roles ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)).

### TLS and Mutual TLS

TLS must be enabled on the CA server and between all network components ([hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io)). For stronger security, **mutual TLS** can be configured so that clients present certificates during communication, ensuring both ends of the channel are authenticated. Orderers and peers should use TLS certificates signed by a trusted CA.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Fabric chaincode can inspect client identities and attributes. Applications may embed attributes (e.g., `role=verifier` or `role=grower`) into X.509 certificates or use external identity providers such as Keycloak. Chaincode functions can call the `GetClientIdentity().GetAttributeValue()` API to enforce RBAC. Endorsement policies at chaincode or collection level ensure that only specific organisations can approve a transaction ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)).

---

## Auditability and Compliance

The immutable blockchain ensures that every transaction, from tree registration to token transfer, is permanently recorded. The ledger comprises a **world state** (current values) and a **blockchain** (transaction history). While the world state can change, the blockchain history cannot be modified ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)). This property provides an indisputable audit trail for environmental credits and token trades. Organisations can implement further audit services: an **AuditContract** logs additional context such as user IDs, client applications and compliance checks.

To meet **GDPR** requirements, private data collections allow data to be purged after a specified number of blocks ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)). Sensitive off-chain data can also be deleted from PostgreSQL while keeping the on-chain hash, preserving proof without exposing personal data.

---

## Benefits of HLF Integration for Treetracker

- **Transparency and Trust:** Channels provide shared, immutable ledgers accessible to authorised participants. The ledger stores the current state and the full history of transactions, making tree planting and token transfers transparent and traceable ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)).

- **Performance and Scalability:** Separating transaction execution, ordering and validation allows Fabric to process many transactions concurrently ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)). Raft consensus scales horizontally; adding more orderer nodes increases throughput while maintaining finality ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)).

- **Interoperability:** Standard APIs (Fabric Gateway) and SDKs in Go, Node/TypeScript and Java simplify application development ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)). Off-chain databases and event listeners integrate easily with existing systems, such as payment platforms or carbon credit marketplaces.

- **Privacy and Confidentiality:** Private data collections restrict data access to authorised organisations, while still allowing participation in shared channels ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)). Off-chain storage and hashing protect sensitive personal or location data.

- **Auditability and Compliance:** The immutable ledger and world state create verifiable, tamper-resistant records ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)). Audit contracts and event listeners can generate reports and support regulatory audits.

- **Cost Efficiency:** By removing intermediaries and automating verification, Fabric reduces transaction costs. Growers and investors transact directly via smart contracts, while sponsors can trace the environmental impact of their contributions.

## Implementation Guidance

To deploy the Treetracker blockchain solution, organisations should follow these steps:

1. **Set up Certificate Authorities:** Deploy a root CA and intermediate CAs for each organisation. Initialise the CA server with a CSR specifying the subject fields ([hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io)). Enable TLS on the CA server ([hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io)).

2. **Generate Identities:** Register and enrol peers, orderers and users via the CA. Create MSP folders containing the certificates and keys for each component. Use HSMs where possible ([hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io)).

3. **Configure Ordering Service:** Create a Raft consortium with an odd number of orderer nodes (3 or 5). Configure the `orderer.yaml` file; specify `ConsensusType: etcdraft`, enable TLS, and define the consenter set. Deploy orderers across data centres for fault tolerance ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)).

4. **Deploy Peers:** Deploy endorsing and committing peers per organisation. Configure the gossip protocol and set anchor peers. Choose CouchDB as the state database for advanced queries ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)). Enable TLS and configure static or dynamic leader election ([hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io)).

5. **Create Channels:** Generate channel configuration transactions (`configtx.yaml`) specifying member organisations, anchor peers and policies. Use a public channel for tree registration and token transfers, and additional channels for sensitive data. Set channel capabilities to the latest Fabric version.

6. **Package and Deploy Chaincode:** Write chaincode for the TreeContract, TokenContract, UserContract and AuditContract. Package and install chaincode on endorsing peers. Organisations approve and commit the chaincode definition with an endorsement policy reflecting the required signatories (e.g., both Greenstand and Verifier must endorse a tree verification). Use private data collections for sensitive fields.

7. **Set up API Gateway and Event Listeners:** Implement a Node.js/TypeScript gateway service using the Fabric Gateway SDK. The gateway should manage wallet identities and map external authentication (e.g., JWT tokens) to Fabric identities. Event listener services should subscribe to block and chaincode events and update the off-chain database.

8. **Integrate Off-Chain Database and Storage:** Deploy PostgreSQL for metadata and MinIO/S3 for images. Ensure that image hashes stored on-chain match the stored files. Implement scheduled tasks for data purging as required by GDPR.

9. **Implement Client Applications:** Enhance the mobile app to compute image hashes and handle offline submission with retries. Build the admin panel for reviewers and the wallet app for token management. Use the web map to display verified trees by querying the off-chain database and cross-checking the blockchain state.

10. **Monitor and Secure the Network:** Use Prometheus and Grafana to monitor peer and orderer health, transaction latency and block height. Configure alerting for quorum loss, leader changes and endorsement failures. Conduct regular audits of identities and MSP configurations.
